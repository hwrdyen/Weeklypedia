# Tech Stack Specification: Weekly Update Assistant

This document outlines the recommended and alternative technology stacks for building the Weekly Update Assistant application, based on the project's PRD. The primary recommendation focuses on a unified JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem for simplicity and speed.

## Recommended Tech Stack: Full-Stack TypeScript

This approach is highly recommended for its cohesiveness, allowing for the entire application to be built, managed, and deployed from a single codebase.

- **Core Framework (Frontend + Backend):** **Next.js (with React)**

  - **Why:** A powerful, full-stack React framework. It enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), while also providing a robust API layer (API Routes) for all backend logic. This simplifies development, tooling, and eliminates the need to manage separate frontend and backend projects.

- **AI Agent & Integration:**

  - **AI Model:** **Google Gemini Pro**
    - **Why:** Meets the user's requirement for a high-quality model with a generous free tier suitable for development and production launch.
  - **Official SDK:** **Google AI SDK for Node.js (`@google/generative-ai`)**
    - **Why:** Provides direct, official access to the Gemini API within the Next.js backend environment.
  - **AI Orchestration Framework:** **LangChain.js**
    - **Why:** While optional, it's highly recommended for structuring complex AI interactions. It simplifies the process of creating "chains" that fetch data from multiple sources (GitHub, Notion), format it into a coherent prompt for Gemini, and process the model's output.

- **Database & Authentication:** **Supabase**

  - **Why:** An all-in-one backend-as-a-service platform that is open-source and built on PostgreSQL. It provides:
    - **Authentication:** Pre-built support for email/password and social OAuth, including a "Log in with GitHub" flow, which is critical for this project.
    - **Database:** A full-featured PostgreSQL database to securely store user data and any necessary API keys or tokens.
    - **Generous Free Tier:** Sufficient for development and early-stage application needs.

- **API Client Libraries (to be used in Next.js backend):**

  - **GitHub Integration:** **Octokit.js (`@octokit/rest`)**
    - **Why:** The official JavaScript SDK for the GitHub API. It simplifies fetching repository data, commits, and pull request details.
  - **Notion Integration:** **Notion SDK for JS (`@notionhq/client`)**
    - **Why:** The official JavaScript SDK for the Notion API, for securely accessing document content.

- **Deployment Platform:** **Vercel**
  - **Why:** As the creators of Next.js, Vercel offers a seamless, zero-configuration deployment experience. It integrates perfectly with Next.js features like serverless functions for the API backend. The free tier is ideal for this project's scope.

## Alternative Tech Stack: Python Backend + JS Frontend

This is a viable alternative, especially if the developer has a strong preference for Python for data processing and AI tasks. It involves managing two separate codebases.

- **Backend Framework:** **FastAPI (Python)**

  - **Why:** A modern, high-performance Python framework for building APIs. It's known for its speed, automatic interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI), and strong typing support with Pydantic.

- **Frontend Framework:** **React (using Vite)** or **SvelteKit**

  - **Why:** A dedicated frontend application that communicates with the FastAPI backend.
    - **React/Vite:** A very popular and powerful combination for building user interfaces with a fast development server.
    - **SvelteKit:** A modern alternative that is often praised for its simplicity and performance, compiling to highly optimized vanilla JavaScript.

- **AI Agent & Integration (Python Backend):**

  - **AI Model:** **Google Gemini Pro**
  - **Official SDK:** **Google AI SDK for Python (`google-generativeai`)**
  - **AI Orchestration Framework:** **LangChain (Python version)**

- **API Client Libraries (Python Backend):**

  - **GitHub Integration:** **PyGithub**
  - **Notion Integration:** **notion-client**

- **Deployment Platform:**
  - **Backend (FastAPI):** **Render** or **Google Cloud Run**.
  - **Frontend (React/Svelte):** **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

## Final Recommendation

For efficiency, speed of development, and ease of management, the **Full-Stack TypeScript stack with Next.js and Supabase** is the superior choice for this project.
