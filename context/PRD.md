# Product Requirements Document: Weekly Update Assistant

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement

Software engineers and other technical professionals spend a significant amount of time each week manually compiling progress updates for their managers and other stakeholders. This process is often tedious, involving the collection of data from multiple sources like GitHub and Notion, and requires translating complex technical achievements into a digestible, non-technical format. This manual effort is inefficient and can lead to inconsistent or incomplete updates.

### 1.2. Proposed Solution

The **Weekly Update Assistant** is a web application designed to automate the creation of weekly progress emails. It will connect to a user's data sources (GitHub, Notion), use a cost-effective AI agent to analyze and summarize contributions over a specific time interval, and generate a draft email written in plain language suitable for a non-technical audience. The user will have the final say, with the ability to review and edit the AI-generated summary before the final email is created.

### 1.3. Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** Software Engineers, Developers, QA Testers, and other technical team members.
- **Secondary Audience (End-Receivers):** Non-technical Managers, Product Managers, and Project Leads who need to understand project progress.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** To drastically reduce the time and effort required for technical team members to report their weekly progress.
- **Secondary Goal:** To improve the clarity and quality of communication between technical and non-technical team members.
- **User Experience Goal:** To provide a simple, fast, and intuitive user interface that requires minimal user effort.

## 3. Features and Functionality

The application's workflow is broken down into four key feature sets:

### Feature 1: Data Input

The user provides the raw materials for the summary.

- **User Story 1.1:** As a user, I want to specify a start and end date for the reporting period.
- **User Story 1.2:** As a user, I want to input a URL to a GitHub repository to be analyzed.
- **User Story 1.3:** As a user, I want to optionally provide direct links to specific GitHub Pull Requests that are most relevant.
- **User Story 1.4:** As a user, I want to optionally provide a link to a Notion page (or paste text) containing my personal notes or documentation for the week.

### Feature 2: AI-Powered Analysis & Summarization

An AI agent processes the inputs to create a structured list of achievements.

- **User Story 2.1:** The system must connect to the GitHub API to fetch all commits and pull request data from the specified repository within the user-defined time interval.
- **User Story 2.2:** The system must be able to access and read the content from the provided GitHub PR links and Notion documentation.
- **User Story 2.3:** The system must use an AI agent to analyze all collected data (commits, PR descriptions, comments, Notion text).
- **User Story 2.4:** The AI agent must generate a concise list of achievements or completed tasks based on its analysis. Each item in the list should represent a distinct piece of work.

### Feature 3: Interactive Review

The user refines the AI's output on the frontend.

- **User Story 3.1:** As a user, I want to see the AI-generated list of achievements clearly displayed on the web page.
- **User Story 3.2:** As a user, I want each achievement to have a checkbox, allowing me to easily include or exclude it from the final email.
- **User Story 3.3:** As a user, I want the ability to edit the text of any achievement to better reflect my work.
- **User Story 3.4:** As a user, I want to be able to manually add a new achievement to the list.

### Feature 4: Email Generation

The application composes the final email.

- **User Story 4.1:** As a user, after I have curated my list of achievements, I want to click a "Generate Email" button.
- **User Story 4.2:** The system must generate a complete email draft targeted at a non-technical reader.
  - The email should have a professional yet friendly tone.
  - It should include a brief opening, a bulleted list of the selected achievements, and a brief closing.
  - The language used must be simple, avoiding technical jargon.
- **User Story 4.3:** As a user, I want to be presented with the final email text and a "Copy to Clipboard" button for easy sharing.

## 4. Technical Considerations

- **Frontend:** A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) to build a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** A server-side language (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI) to handle API integrations and orchestrate the AI agent.
- **AI Agent:**
  - Utilize a cost-effective, fast LLM (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-3.5-Turbo) for summarization and text generation tasks.
  - Use a framework like LangChain or LlamaIndex to structure the AI agent's workflow (data fetching -> summarization -> generation).
- **APIs & Authentication:**
  - **GitHub:** Use the GitHub API. The application should handle authentication via OAuth to allow users to securely grant access to their private repositories.
  - **Notion:** Use the Notion API. The user will likely need to provide an API key, and the application must handle this securely.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** All user credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys) must be handled securely, encrypted at rest, and transmitted over HTTPS. Avoid storing tokens long-term where possible.
- **Performance:** The entire process, from data input to email generation, should feel fast. The AI processing step should not keep the user waiting for an unreasonable amount of time.
- **Usability:** The UI must be clean, simple, and self-explanatory. The user should be able to generate an update in under a minute.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** Number of weekly active users.
- **Task Success Rate:** Percentage of users who successfully generate and copy an email.
- **Qualitative Feedback:** User surveys and feedback on the quality and accuracy of the generated email content.
